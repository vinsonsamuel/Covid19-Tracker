# Covid-19 Tracker App

This Project is a beginner friendly project I built using React. Some key Aspects:

- Shows Live Cases, Recoveries, Deaths (clickable tabs)
- Shows Worldwide cases and Country Based cases
- Line Chart shows fluctuations over days, hover around to see exact figures
- Clickable Markers on Map show Country stats

Deployed live on https://covid-19-tracker-d35b9.web.app/ . Check out!
